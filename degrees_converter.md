# Approximate Metric Equivalents for Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds

At the equator for longitude and for latitude anywhere, the following approximations are valid:

    1° = 111 km  (or 60 nautical miles)
    
    0.1° = 11.1 km
    
    0.01° = 1.11 km (2 decimals, km accuracy)
    
    0.001° =111 m
    
    0.0001° = 11.1 m
    
    0.00001° = 1.11 m
    
    0.000001° = 0.11 m (7 decimals, cm accuracy)

    1' = 1.85 km  (or 1 nautical mile)
    
    0.1' = 185 m
    
    0.01' = 18.5 m
    
    0.001' = 1.85 m

    30" = 900 m
    
    15" = 450 m
    
    3" = 90 m
    
    1" = 30 m
    
    1/3" = 10 m
    
    0.1" = 3 m
    
    1/9" = 3 m
    
    1/27" = 1 m

If you report a position to the nearest 0.01°  (two decimal places for latitude and longitude), you will only be accurate to around 1 km.  While this is adequate for rough locations on a global scale, for detailed work it will be inadequate.
